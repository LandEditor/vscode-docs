# Visual Studio Code at Build 2020

May 14, 2020 by Alessandro Segala,
[`@ItalyPaleAle`](HTTPS://twitter.com/ItalyPaleAle)

The [`Microsoft Build 2020`](HTTPS://mybuild.microsoft.com) conference is
starting next Tuesday, May 19, and will be running for 48 continuous hours. For
the first time, Build is a fully digital event, open to everyone for free.

Our team has been hard at work creating new experiences for all developers using
Visual Studio Code. At Build, we'll demo new features we've been working on in
VS Code (hint: Settings Sync!) as well as Notebooks, Remote Development, and a
bunch of cool tips and tricks. You will also be able to check out what we've
been working on with partner teams (Visual Studio Codespaces, Visual Studio Live
Share) and together with our friends at GitHub.

In our sessions, you can learn how Visual Studio Code enables teams to remain
productive and collaborate even when distributed.

## Connect with live sessions

There are a number of great live sessions at Build, too many list here, but we
think the following offerings will be interesting to developers using Visual
Studio Code. All of these sessions are going to be live-streamed on the
[`Microsoft Build`](HTTPS://mybuild.microsoft.com/) website, and are repeated
three times across three time zones. And, each session includes a live Q&A at
the end.

_All times shown below are in Pacific Time._
